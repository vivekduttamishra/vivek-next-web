          <h3>The Storyteller</h3>
            <p>Vivek possesses a multifaceted identity that transcends conventional boundaries. He has gained recognition as an esteemed author, with two bestselling books delving into the profound world of the Mahabharata. His debut masterpiece, "The Accursed God — The Lost Epic Book 1," received resounding acclaim, establishing his prowess as a wordsmith. Such was its popularity that even before its official release, his second book, "Manas (मानस)," a poetic narrative based on authentic reference of Mahabharata, attained best-seller status during its special invite preview.</p>
            <p>However, Vivek's talents extend far beyond his role as an accomplished author. His insatiable appetite for knowledge has driven him to become an avid reader, a captivating storyteller, a skillful poet, and a stage play director. Additionally, Vivek has made a name for himself as a regular podcaster, sharing his wisdom and engaging narratives with a wide audience. He has also collaborated with fellow authors in several anthologies, showcasing his versatility and creative prowess.</p>
            <p>Drawing upon his extensive study of ancient Indian epics and literature, Vivek has assumed the role of a "Storian." Through his various platforms, such as the popular podcast show "Mahabharata Ek Khoj," he seeks to unveil the authentic version of the Mahabharata, dispelling misconceptions and shedding light on its profound wisdom and philosophy. By unraveling the interpolations that have distorted this ancient epic, Vivek aims to restore its true essence, relying on authentic references from antiquity.</p>
